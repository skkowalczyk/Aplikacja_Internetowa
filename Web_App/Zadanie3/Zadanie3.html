      When the pimp's in the crib ma<br>
      Drop it like it's hot<br>
      Drop it like it's hot<br>
      Drop it like it's hot<br>
      When the pigs try to get at ya<br>
      Park it like it's hot<br>
      Park it like it's hot<br>
      Park it like it's hot<br>
      And if a nigga get a attitude<br>
      Pop it like it's hot<br>
      Pop it like it's hot<br>
      Pop it like it's hot<br><br>

      I got the Rolly on my arm and I'm pouring Chandon<br>
      And I roll the best weed 'cause I got it going on<br><br>

      I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams<br>
      See these ice cubes, see these Ice Creams?<br>
      Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat<br>
      That's whiter than what's spilling down your throat<br>
      The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs<br>
      The interior like suicide wrist red<br>
      I can exercise you, this could be your Phys. Ed<br>
      Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get a his head<br>
      Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street<br>
      With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat<br><br>

      So don't try to run up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit<br>
      Tryna ask me shit, when my niggas fill ya vest they ain't gon' pass me shit<br>
      You should think about it, take a second<br>
      Matter fact, you should take four B<br>
      And think before you fuck with lil' skateboard<br><br>

      When the pimp's in the crib ma<br>
      Drop it like it's hot<br>
      Drop it like it's hot<br>
      Drop it like it's hot<br>
      When the pigs try to get at ya<br>
      Park it like it's hot<br>
      Park it like it's hot<br>
      Park it like it's hot<br>
      And if a nigga get a attitude<br>
      Pop it like it's hot<br>
      Pop it like it's hot<br>
      Pop it like it's hot<br><br>
